# Disease-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Features:
Predicts diseases from multiple input symptoms
Uses a machine learning classification algorithm (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
Clean and user-friendly command-line interface
Preprocessing of medical data for improved accuracy
Includes evaluation metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (for ML algorithms)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations, if included)

ðŸ©¹ How It Works"
User inputs symptoms (e.g., fatigue, cough, headache)
The symptoms are mapped to a feature vector
The trained ML model predicts the most likely disease
Output is displayed with predicted disease name and (optionally) confidence score
